"# Design-Patterns" 

"# Creational Design Patterns"

"# 1. Singleton Pattern:"

    Singleton Pattern restricts the intialization of a class to one single instance.
    It helps in controlling the acess to a single instance.
    It reduces the resource usage.
    Centralised Management.
    Simplified Design.
    Prevention of unintended instantiation.

"2. Factory Pattern"

    Used for creation of objects.
    Abstracts the creation of objects from clients.
    Client should be able to pass the name of the type of object which he neeeds, and need not worry about the implementation of creation of objects.

"3. Builder Pattern"

    Used for creation of complex objects.
    Avoids Telescoping constructors.
    Increases readability, Step by step way to build complex objects.

"4. Abstract Factory Pattern"

    The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
    It is especially useful in situations where you want to build different configurations of a set of objects, or when you want the flexibility to change the product families during runtime.
    Supportd Open/Closed Principle

"# Behavioral Design Patterns"

"1. Observer Pattern"

    Decouples the subject and observer.
    Promotes Consistency.
    Improves Reusability and extensibility.
    Supports dynamic and runtime changes.(For example in a chat app users can join or leave a group dynamically).

"# Structural Design Patterns"

"1. Adapter Design Pattern"

    The Adapter Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects. 
    This pattern is commonly used when integrating new components or legacy systems with existing code, making the interaction seamless without altering the involved classes.
    Enables interoperability between incompatible interfaces.
    Facilitates Legacy code integrations.
