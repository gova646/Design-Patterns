"# Creational Design Patterns"

1. Singleton Pattern:
    Singleton Pattern restricts the intialization of a class to one single instance.
    It helps in controlling the acess to a single instance.
    It reduces the resource usage.
    Centralised Management.
    Simplified Design.
    Prevention of unintended instantiation.

2. Factory Pattern
    Used for creation of objects.
    Abstracts the creation of objects from clients.
    Client should be able to pass the name of the type of object which he neeeds, and need not worry about the implementation of creation of objects.

3. Builder Pattern

    Avoids Telescoping constructors.
    Increases readability, Step by step way to build complex objects.

"# Behavioral Design Patterns"
